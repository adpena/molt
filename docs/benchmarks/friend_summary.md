## Notes
- Semantic mode values: `runs_unmodified`, `requires_adapter`, `unsupported_by_molt`.
- `Molt/Friend` values > 1.0 indicate Molt is faster on the suite median.
- Compile-vs-run separation is recorded per runner when build commands are configured.

## Non-OK Suites
- `codon_benchmarks`: skipped (no runnable runners)
- `pypy_benchmarks`: skipped (no runnable runners)
- `nuitka_benchmarks`: skipped (no runnable runners)
- `cython_benchmarks`: skipped (no runnable runners)
- `numba_benchmarks`: skipped (no runnable runners)
