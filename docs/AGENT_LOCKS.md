# Agent Locks

This file coordinates parallel agent work to prevent file collisions.

## How to use
- Claim a file or directory by adding a line: `<agent-id> -> <path>`.
- Keep claims narrow and time-bound.
- Remove your claim when finished.

## Active locks
- codex -> runtime/molt-runtime/, runtime/molt-backend/, src/molt/, tests/, docs/spec/, wit/
